# Ping-Master
A simple pinging app for iOS. Initially was to be submitted to the App Store, but was scrapped, so we released for free and open source for anyone who wants to use it or build onto it. Pull requests are encouraged.

Leverages the excellent GBPing library (https://github.com/lmirosevic/GBPing).
